<h1>Homework 7:Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Amelia Loeffler</h2>
<h3>This map shows how many bourbon distilleries are in each county in Kentucky, as well as the railroads in Kentucky. I chose this topic because I am from Kentucky, and 95% of the world's bourbon is made in Kentucky. The expansion of railroads during the industrial revolution was a large contributing factor to the expansion of the bourbon industry in Kentucky, so I included the railroads on my map to show how counties that are better connected to trade via ralroads have more distilleries.  </h3>
